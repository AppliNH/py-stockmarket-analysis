To use this, please create a `.env` file at the root of the project, and fill it with :

You can get a finnhub api key [here](https://finnhub.io/).

It is used to retrieve the latest stock market data.

Then, install [pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/), run `pipenv install`, and eventually `python main.py`

Or, just simply `pipenv run python3.8 main.py`.
